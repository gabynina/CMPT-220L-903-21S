     * In our Assignment here we're running a little lemonade stand and we also sell pretzels. We need to keep track of
     * our inventory as well as the money that we're making throughout the day. I have code in the wet code section that
     * keeps track of all of this poorly. Come up with a better way to manage our system. There's not just one way to do
     * this so get creative and most importantly remember to stay DRY!
     *
     * We're gonna look at the first hour where we have 15 customers!
     *
     * We're responsible for keeping track of the number of pretzels and lemonades sold as well as the cash on hand and
     * in the tip jar! To keep things easy I won't make you make change! At the end of the day tips are split among the
     * employees! That means DON'T add it to the cash at the end of the day or during a transaction
     *
     * At the end we're going to print out our inventory left and how much we made in case for the day! Print out the
     * tips too!
     *
     * Remember to use functions, variables, and whatever else would make this easier to maintain!
     *
     * Pretzels are $2 for 1
     * Lemonade is $8 for 1
