    "- For every customer the pretezel and lemonade inventory decreased by how many were purchased \n",

    "- The cash at hand was calculated by multiplying the amount of pretzels or lemonades purchased by its unit price.\n",

    "To make the dry code I needed to create a function called order() that concised all the information in the wet code\n",
    "- The function accepts three parameters, the number of pretzels, lemondae purchased and tips\n",
    "- I then added two varibales to my intial varibales for the prices of each lemonade (lemonade_Price) and each pretzel (pretzel_Price) that would be purchased \n",
    "- I then created a forumla that would update the number of preztels avalibale by subtracting the number of pretzels purchased from the inventory \n",
    "- I then used a very similar formula to update the number of lemonades purchased from the inventory \n",
    "- I then created a formula to calculate the tips total.\n",
    "- Then to keep track of the cash at hand I created a forumla that calculated the sum of the number of pretzels purchased multiplied by the price of pretzels along with the lemonades purchased\n",
