For my binary search tree I began by I creating a node class that creates a node for the tree.
I then created a new class called BST that holds all the functions to manipulate the tree. I 
created a function that inserted a new element into the tree, deleted an element from a tree and searched
for a specific element in a tree. I then created the Depth first search functions using
the three traversal methods: in order, post order, and pre order. I then created a function to 
execute my breadth first search. along with all of those I created two functions that keep track 
of the min and max numbers in the tree. 

I created a demo showing my tree.
